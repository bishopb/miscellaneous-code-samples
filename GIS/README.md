PHP GIS Library
===============

You've got PHP, and you want to work with a Geographic Information System (GIS). Here is some love.

Source File/Directory | Overview
--------------------- | --------
MBR.php | Implements a Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR), which allows you to add coordinates into it and then calculate the coordinates of the smallest rectangle surrounding them all.
Geocode | Implements all you need to convert addresses into geographic coordinates using either the Google or Yahoo geocoding services.
OpenLayers | PHP interface to the OpenLayers Javascript library. Now, you can write PHP and get pretty OpenLayers maps lickety-split.
