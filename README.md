Tasty free samples
==================

From time to time, I'm asked for code samples.  Find them here.

Understand these are just fragments.  Tiny little tidbits of code and not part of any cohesive framework.



Source File/Directory | Overview
--------------------- | ---------------------
**GIS** | A collection of PHP code to create Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
**Zend_View_Duration_Helper** | As the name suggests, this is a Zend Framework view helper that outputs duration values in a human-friendly string.  For example, instead of outputing "77 seconds left", with this helper you could output "1 minute 17 seconds left".<br>What sets this helper apart is that the format is entirely flexible, being driven by *printf()* style specifiers. This allows the format string to be easily passed through i18n language translation.<br>[Discussion of this helper, esp. the `clone()` call in the constructor.](http://www.ideacode.com/content/super-charged-view-helpers)
**Dojo-Forms-with-Templating-and-Internationalization** | This collection of files showcases how to blend Dojo's 1.8 templated forms, with internationalization.<br>[The source blog post has become the definitive guide to this often repeated tasks.](http://www.ideacode.com/content/the-definitive-guide-to-powerhouse-dojo-dialog-forms)
**LoadData.sql** | Demonstrates a quick SQL statement for sucking in CSV formatted data, fast, while also fixing any quirks in the data.<br>[Discussed in detail in this blog post.](http://www.ideacode.com/content/mysql-csv-load-fu)
