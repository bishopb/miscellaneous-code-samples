From time to time, I'm asked for code samples.  Find them here.

Zend_View_Duration_Helper | As the name suggests, this is a Zend Framework view helper that outputs duration values in a human-friendly string.  For example, instead of outputing "77 seconds left", with this helper you could output "1 minute 17 seconds left".

What sets this helper apart is that the format is entirely flexible, being driven by *printf()* style specifiers. This allows the format string to be easily passed through i18n language translation.
