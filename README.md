Zend_View_Duration_Helper | As the name suggests, this is a Zend Framework view helper that outputs duration values in a human-friendly string.  For example, instead of outputing "77 seconds left", with this helper you could output "1 minute 17 seconds left".<br>What sets this helper apart is that the format is entirely flexible, being driven by *printf()* style specifiers.
